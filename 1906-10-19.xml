                <div type="article">
                    <p>foreign policy, it was inevitable that the young Ruler could not remain for
                        ever the servant uf his Chancellor’s over-mastering will. His own force of
                        character, his restless energy and indomitable self-confidence urged hun on
                        to make head against the menace of a “Bismarck dynasty." The absolutism of
                        the Chancellor found a counterpoise in the restless and alert young Cæsar,
                        whose eagerness to come into personal contact with his ministers, to
                        understand how the administration really worked, drove his greatest subject
                        to resign. One reads with a real pleasure Bismarck s final warning to
                        Hohenlohe : "Keep him off the subject of Alsace-Lorraine," and the Stadt-
                        halter’s melancholy, “Easier said than done. ’ The Wilhelm II. of the
                        Hohenlohe letters is the Wilhelm II. of the Kruger telegiam, of the naval
                        agitation, of a multitude of vigorous speeches, and of some very real
                        achievements, and of the motto, written with his own hand in the Golden Book
                        of Munich, “régis voluntas suprema lex." Another side—dare we call it the
                        “breezy” side—of the Kaiser’s character is happily depicted. He grasps
                        Hohenlohe's hand with a vigour worthy of Giitz von Berlichingen of the iron
                        grip and startles that elderly and respect- able statesman by drinking to
                        him with such sudden emphasis that he all but spills his cham- pagne in
                        raising his glass in reply. He describes the closing scenes of the conflict
                        as “simply lieastly,” he narrates his version of the quarrel in spirited
                        detail to Hohenlohe as they drive together to the shooting box at
                        Sufflenheim, and avows his own ambition in his frank re- cognition of the
                        fact that William the Great, whose place in the history of the Fatherland
                        was known to all the world, might adopt, without a whisper of criticism, a
                        repressive policy of which his grandson—who had as yet done nothing—could
                        not dream. The words which we have underlined are a prophecy of the
                        Welt-Politik to come. We do not see Bismarck at his best. Obviously it was
                        only the memory of his past services that kept the Ministers loyal to a
                        chief who had achieved marvels but was sinking to the level of an unamiable
                        tyrant. One feds instinctively that by 1880 Bismarck’s part was played. In
                        the years of storm and battle he was the great pilot, a Norse. Sea King
                        delighting in the opposition which he beat down with hammer strokes, a lover
                        of strife and tempest, hard-bitten, unscrupulous, and subtle, above all a
                        man of infinite craft and of an amazingly narrow clearness of vision. As in
                        Slukespeare s Julius Cæsar it is the spirit of the Cæsar of the Gallic and
                        Civil Wars that dominates the drama, so in these letters the Bismarck of
                        1866 and 1870 still lords it over timid subordinates and trembling foes. In
                        the Kaiser we have the new Germany personified : less restrained, less
                        prudent than the old, but more ambitious, more flexible, and, we believe,
                        less narrow. Bismarck must crush the Socialists, Kaiser Wilhelm will dash to
                        pieces the “Vaterlandslose Gesellen’’ who oppose him, but first the legiti-
                        mate grievances of the workmen must be redressed. Russia must lie
                        conciliated ; but is Austria, the ally, to be abandoned for the sake of
                        brokerage ? Even Prince Hoheulohe express- es his doubt whether the policy
                        of aiding Austria against a Russo-French combination is wise, but the Kaiser
                        will stand by his ally, and Algesiras shows that here at least good faith
                        has been rewarded. We have another sketch, too —the Tsar—• serenely
                        optimistic, pushing on to the Far East, “where our destiny lies," before the
                        Japanese can complete their preparations. His Majesty is pleased to express
                        his odiuiration of their cleanliness and civility, magnanimously over- looks
                        the assault of a fanatic upon his sacred person,aiul while laying plans for
                        their absorp tion or overthrow, declares that it will give him real pain to
                        do them any harm. Wo are reminded of the report sent by the Russian Consul
                        at Shanghai to tho efiect that the Japanese Consul at Woo-Sung had persuaded
                        the Chinese authorities to intern the luckless gunboat Manjûr, and annotated
                        by the im- perial hand with the sublime comment, “That Japanese Consul is a
                        very wicked man." Such arc the straits to which cruel ovents reduce even the
                        Ixjst intentioned of monarchs ! </p>

                        last pay some attention to the conduct of affairs in Egypt and the Sudan,
                        and one of the most vital matters about which questions were asked was the
                        import of spirituous liquors into the Sudan. There appears to be a ten-
                        dency to resent any animadversion made on Egyptian matters in the House of
                        Commons, as though the management of this oountry til mid be immune from
                        criticism, bat all well- wishers of the coantry should welcome any
                        intelligent interest that is manifested. There was a series of questions

                        wh:ch were of the utmost importance to the fature welfare of the Sudan. In

                        attention of Sir Reginald Wingate to the large amoant of spirits imported
                        daring 1900 into the Sadan. it then amounted to LE. 8,400 (250 tons). Last

                        five years, and were valned at LE 81,000. The matter will be taken np

                        Commons will keep an eye on the matter. We append the text of three
                        questions, which were asked in the House daring last Jane. On the 12th of
                        that month, Sir H. Cotton (Nottingham) asked the Seoretaryof State for
                        Foreign Affairs "whether he will famish or procure information showing in
                        detail and as far as possible the plaoes of origin and the quantities and

                        Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grjy), replied : We have
                        no infor- mation on the subject other than that contained in Lord Cromer’s
                        reports, but Lord Cromer will be asked if he can give the farther infor-
                        mation asked fir. Sir H. Cotton : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs whether any, and, if so, what steps have been taken with

                        spirits which seemed to have been imported into the Sadan (od. 1012), page
                        63, and that in 1904 Sir Reginald Wingate’s attention had been drawn to the

                        import and sale of alcjholio liquors in their territory. These regulations
                        have been modified and added to from time to time, and the matter is one

                    <p>A KHARTOUM EPISODE.</p>
                    <p>An interesting work, entitled "With Lord Kitchener against the Mahdi,” will
                        shortly be pablii-hed by a Berlin publishing house. The writer, Major Adolf
                        von Tiedemann, who ac- companied the Sadan expedition as repre- sentative of
                        the Berlin General Staff, gives the following impressions : "Lord
                        Kitohener’s lack of consideration is well known, and for just that reason,
                        although admired and respected, he is unpopular with other offioers. On the
                        day fixed for the celebra- tion in Khartoum, the company had been order- ed
                        to be in readiness by six a.m. We stood hoar after hoar, but no Sirdar
                        arrived. Eight o’olook oame and went, and then the snn began to burn.
                        Appeariig, however, at nine o’clock, Lord Kitchener wenton beard his gunboat
                        with- out a single word of excuse or explanation. "Later we learned from one
                        of his adjutants that it had ooourred to him suddenly that morning that he
                        had not yet visited the wounded in hospital, so there he had gone without
                        bothering himself about anything else. Reason for Unpopularity. "Another
                        reason, perhaps, for his unpopular- ity is that when 'off doty’ he keeps
                        aloof from the familiar interooarse whioh so often exists among English
                        offioers of very different rank. He is body and sonl a soldier, and his
                        military instincts tell h:m that this oannot be right. I had an impression
                        that it pleased him when I maintained that respeot for superiors whioh we
                        knew so well in Germany. Kitohener often called me to him daring the march
                        and con- versed abont military conditions in the Father- land. "I seldom saw
                        Lord Kitohener riding at a gallop daring a battle, but when he did, even
                        over places covered with great stones, he rode like an expert horseman. He
                        irheld to be one of the best horsemen in an army where every officer is more
                        or less a good rider. "Without in the least being guilty of bravado, the
                        Sirdar seemed absolutely insen- sible to personal danger. The entranoe of
                        Omdurman was not mnoh less than a mad piece of bravery. His ooolness had
                        something humoroas in it. For instance, once when the guDS were roaring
                        away, Kitohener stopped to light his cigarette, quite unoouoerned—in fact,
                        carefully noting which way the wind blew. "Ou his way to England, after the
                        oampaign, he said, ‘Now oomes the worst part of the war,’ and truly he had
                        more horror of banquets, hurrahs, and receptions than of the heat, dirt, and
                        stink of the Sadan. "The Sirdar had overcome the enemy and seized the prizs
                        afters years of work and priva- tion. He had crashed Mahdism and avenged
                        Gordon. But as the hero stood on the ruins of Gordon’s house, while the
                        flags flaw and the cannon thundered, he ooold not repress his feelings, and
                        tho tears rolled down his weather - broi zed face. Happy the man to whom
                        such an hoar of life is given !" </p>

                    <p>Mr. Wilfrid Blunt is not above taking full advantage of the work of Lord
                        Cromer in Egypt when it comes to a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence.
                        Part of his estate at Matarieh has already been parcelled off in building
                        sites and a number of each sold, possibly to speculators who hope to get rid
                        of them to others at a higher price than they paid for them. These lands,
                        whioh are desert pure and simple, were pnrohased a few years ago for a few
                        napoleons the feddan. They are now being offered to the publio generally at
                        the rate of L.E. 801 the feddan. There is nothing atrocioaa in Mr.Blont
                        taking advantage of the boom and disposing, for L.E. 40,000 or L.E. 50,000,
                        of lands whioh possibly oost him as many half piastres, bat there is
                        something very muoh bordering upon a realtmd up-to-date "atrocity” ia the
                        laying oat of these desirable sites for ^Wbtry residences. The main roads on
                        the Blunt property are five metres wide and the by-roads four metres only.
                        Oa the buildiog sites immediately ad- joining the Blunt property the main
                        roads are 16 metres wide and the by-roads either 10 or 12 metres. How those
                        viotimised into buying building sites on the Blunt property are to provide
                        footpaths on each side of even the main roads and leave room fjr a
                        hand-barrow to get in with their goods and ohattels, good- ness only knows.
                        And is it not time that the attention of the Pablio Health Department and
                        the Pablio Works Department should be called to the mattar Î To permit of a

                        the first favoarable opportunity, and this so that Mr. Blunt or his agents
                        may squeeze the people ot his adopted country ont of the uttermost farthing
                        to be got for his precioas desert lands. </p>

                    <head>A RADICAL ON LORD CROMER.</head>
                    <p> Mr. Harold Spender, writing on "England, Egypt and Turkey,” in the ourrent
                        "Contem- porary Review,’’ holds that strong or excep- tional measures should
                        be direotel not so much against ,the fellaheen as against the Turkish
                        agitators or Egyptians in the pay of the Turks. Coming from the pen of so
                        strong a Radical as Mr. Spender, his testimony to the wisdom, the eudaring
                        patience, and the justice of Lord Cromer's role is very remarkable. As Mr.
                        Spender well pats it — "We have achieved their [the Egyptian peasantry’ll]
                        happiness , we must work patient ly for their loyalty. We have no reason to
                        be a-hamed of oar reoord. We have respeotçd the Moslem religion, observed
                        the Moslem Friday, tanght the Koran in oar Bohools, and given to Moslems a
                        preference both on the bench and in the Civil Servioe. We mast not be tarrel
                        aside from this straight coarse. We most wean the Egyptians from the Tark,
                        not wrench them. The world has enough cages for black men. A sullen and
                        cowed population would be a heavy price to pay for our con- tinued
                        occupation—a sad ending to a great and glorious page in oar history. It
                        woald a real triuaq h for the Sultan. For what we really have to defend from
                        him is not our power, which he cannot tooch, bat oar British justice, sanity
                        and mercy.”</p>

                        being continued. It is well to note that in the very great majority of
                        instances the banks are content with registering packages containing sums of
                        money to no matter what value. The reason for this is not far to seek. By
                        registration only £2 can be Teoovered and by insaranoe L.E.400 It is
                        therefore no advantage to the banks to register or insare with the Post
                        Office and they consequently insare to the fall amoant with Rome insaranoe
                        oompany. By the regulations of the Post Office the publio are boand to
                        insare and declare "papers of value, such as paper money, deeds of sale,

                        seeing that in all respeots they will then rank pari passu with the shares
                        quoted on the London Stock Exchange. In issuing the notice of call the
                        following commanioation is addressed to the share holders by the Seoretary :
                        "In sending you the accompanying Call Notice, I am directed point oat that
                        the Board deoided upon making this Call so as to ensure the uninterrupt- ed
                        continuance of the construction of the Western Oases Railway, in order that
                        the accumulating Oases freight may be handled at an early date. At present
                        platelaying is proceeding between kilometres 67 and 91, to whioh latter
                        point the line is completely graded in readiness for laying. Orders for the
                        delivery of the balance of permanent way material have beon given, together
                        with instruc- tions for the sending forward of large supplies now ready for
                        shipment. Every effort will he made to complete the line as early as
                        possible in the ensuing year.” We understand that the reanltf obtained on
                        the experimental plots on the new lands brought into cultivation around the
                        wells sank by the drilling staff have been so very socoessful that the
                        London Board are desirous of being put in a position to largely supplement
                        the steam drillers at present at work in the Oases and to undertake land
                        development on a very extensive Boale. Consequently as soon as the large
                        supplies of permanent way material can be transported we shall see the rate

                        extreme im- portance in view of the ex’ensive character of the grants of
                        land—600,000 feddans - to which the Corporation is entitled. The aluminous

                    pocket1» of feeds, the Hardy Patent Pick Com-
                    pany, of Sheffield, have introduced a patent
                    antomatio continuous fe d for disintegrators.
                    This consists of a revolving internal drum or
                    barrel, having oonioal pookets round periphery
                    of drum from edge to edge, and arranged in a
                    spiral or worm form. The material is fed into
                    a hopper, whioh is fixed to the top of the feed
                    dram ; the revolving aotion of the dram carries
                    the material, whioh is deposited in the pookets,
                    to the disoharge opening—fitted at the bottom
                    of the drum box,—and thsn discharges it into
                    the mouth ol the grinding maohine iu a steady
                    and oontinaous f jed, thereby considerably in-
                    creasing the oatput of the grinding mill. We
                    strongly recommend intending purchasers of
                    grinding machines to adopt the above feed,
                    the results obtained, both in quality aod
                    oatput of material, being extremely satisfactory.
